# How to take care of distributed data?

How can we keep persistent data across multiple data sources? 

Introduction:
In a micro service architecture, like my personal project where multiple services handle user information and credentials, communication is needed to ensure data persistency. Messaging plays a vital role in enabling communication and ensuring the secure retrieval and deletion of data across these services. This document provides an overview of how distributed data is handled using messaging, highlighting the benefits and considerations associated with this approach.

1. Messaging for Data Retrieval:
When retrieving user information and credentials from distributed services, messaging offers several advantages:
a. Asynchronous Communication: Messaging allows services to communicate asynchronously, decoupling the request and response processes. This enhances system responsiveness and scalability, as services can handle requests concurrently.
b. Loose Coupling: Services are loosely coupled, as they communicate through messages rather than directly accessing each other's data. This reduces dependencies and enhances the flexibility to evolve individual services independently.
c. Request-Reply Model: Messaging supports the request-reply model, where a service sends a request message to another service and awaits a response. This facilitates data retrieval, as services can exchange information securely and reliably.

2. Secure Data Retrieval:
To ensure secure data retrieval, consider the following practices:
a. Authentication and Authorization: Implement authentication mechanisms to validate the identity of the requesting service. Authorization rules should restrict access to specific data based on roles and permissions.
b. Encryption: Encrypt sensitive data during transmission to prevent unauthorized access. Utilize secure communication protocols (e.g., SSL/TLS) and encrypt the data at rest in databases or storage systems.
c. Message Encryption: For further security, messages themselves can be encrypted. This safeguards the data payload from being intercepted or tampered with during transit.

3. Messaging for Data Deletion:
Messaging can also be employed for securely deleting user information and credentials:
a. Event-Driven Approach: Instead of directly deleting data from services, an event-driven approach can be adopted. When a deletion request is initiated, a message is sent to relevant services, notifying them to delete the corresponding data.
b. Data Retention Policies: Establish data retention policies to define how long user data should be retained before deletion. Messaging can help enforce these policies by triggering deletion messages after the specified retention period.

4. Considerations and Best Practices:
a. Idempotency: Services should handle messages in an idempotent manner, meaning that processing the same message multiple times has the same outcome as processing it once. This ensures data consistency and prevents unintended duplicate deletions or retrievals.
b. Error Handling and Monitoring: Implement robust error handling mechanisms and comprehensive monitoring to identify and resolve issues promptly. Monitor message queues, service health, and message processing metrics to ensure reliability and timely response.
c. Scalability: Design messaging infrastructure to handle increasing loads and accommodate additional services. Consider using scalable message brokers or streaming platforms to support high volumes of messages efficiently.

Conclusion:
In a distributed system, messaging enables secure and efficient data retrieval and deletion across multiple services. By leveraging asynchronous communication, loose coupling, and secure practices, services can seamlessly exchange user information and credentials while maintaining data integrity and system scalability. Consider the mentioned best practices and adapt them to your specific system requirements for effective distributed data handling using messaging.
