# Reading guide

## Introduction
This document is created to help the reader use this document to easily find certain products and sum up all the context. The reading guide is written for my personal portfolio to prove my level of proficiency on some enterprise software engineering topics. There are nine learning outcomes that are related to this topic and need proof of my knowledge I will be gathering during this semester. To proof this I will be working on two projects: a group and individual project. 


< Explanation document, reading guide, …>
This guide guides the reader through the contents of your portfolio and shows where you stand in relation to your learning outcomes at a particular moment in the semester.
The portfolio is the collection of all partial results that you have achieved at a particular moment (snapshot) in the semester. This snapshot is made at the end of a sprint. For each learning outcome, you describe at what level you are. In addition, in the evaluation of each sprint, you describe the steps you are going to take to reach the next level.
At the end of the semester, your portfolio contains partial results that demonstrate that you have performed at a proficient level for all learning outcomes. You also conclude at that moment with a conclusion, which reflects on how your semester went.
Partial outcomes are all the products you have realised for the individual and pro task project: you can think of: Code, documents, snapshots, projects of followed tutorials, interviews, etcetera.
The portfolio and your reading guide are growing during the semester.

< Explanation of individual project>.
<Explain your starting knowledge, experience, interests and what you would like to learn and achieve this semester>.



## Learning outcomes
Indicate where you think you are on the development scale, based on the feedback from your teachers. 
Describe to the reader for each learning outcome what you have achieved during the past sprint and why this contributes to the learning outcome. Substantiate the why with feedback from your technical tutors. 
The portfolio grows with content; sometimes certain content will no longer be relevant. Describe each sprint from the current status of your portfolio.  You use hyperlinks to refer the reader directly to material in your portfolio.
(Reflection on progress) indicate where you are now and what your tutors have given as feedback to grow further on the development scale.


### Learning outcome 1 - Future-oriented Organization
<Description learning outcome>
Development (undefined, orienting, beginning, proficient, advanced)

ID	Beschrijving	Type	Level
1.1	Sprint 0	Group project	
| Id | Description | Type | Level |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1.1  | Sprint 0 | Group project  |  Orienting |
| 1.2 |   |   |  Individual project |
|   |   |   |   |

Substantiation

1.1: Sprint 0

For example: In the last sprint an initial architecture was realised based on an analysis of the customer requirements. These wishes were obtained by means of interviews and event storming. With these results, we as a team show that we map out the requirements via a backlog in a professional manner. 
1.2: Sprint 1
In the individual project I have bla bla bla.
Reflection on my progress

1:1: Sprint 0

My semester coach indicated (link to feedback) that as a group we need to apply a clear scrum process. We are not yet able to give insight into the burndown. For that, we need a tighter storypoint planning and remainng storypoint estimation per stand-up. Once we have convincingly laid down the process, we move up the development scale to 'beginning'.




### Learning Outcome 2 - Investigative Problem-Solving 

### Learning Outcome 3 - Personal Leadership

### Learning Outcome 4 - Targeted Interaction

### Learning Outcome 5 - Scalable Architectures

### Learning Outcome 6 - Development and Operations (DevOps)

### Learning Outcome 7 - Cloud Services

### Learning Outcome 8 - Security by Design

### Learning Outcome 9 – Distributed Data

## Reflection
Reflect here on your (study) process per sprint.
Where are you getting stuck, what is going well, where do you need help. This is not about the content; you have described this in the learning outcomes. 
Sprint 0
Sprint 1
Sprint 2
Sprint 3
Sprint 4
Sprint 5


## Conclusion
Here, at the end of the semester, you reflect on your process and end result. You can also refer back to the goals you set in the introduction, to see to what extent you were able to achieve them. 
Also mention what you are proud of, what you would like to do differently in the coming semesters and whether you have come to different insights about the field of study. Is there perhaps a particular subject you would like to explore further?
