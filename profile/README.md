# Reading guide

## Introduction
This document is created to help the reader use this document to easily find certain products and sum up all the context. The reading guide is written for my personal portfolio to prove my level of proficiency on some enterprise software engineering topics. There are nine learning outcomes that are related to this topic and need proof of my knowledge I will be gathering during this semester. To proof this I will be working on two projects: a group and individual project. 

### Group project - Stockbrood
The group project will be done by our group existing of five students and one product owner (PO). The PO is a trader on multiple markets and is looking for a way to automate testing his trading strategies. Everything about this project can be found [here](https://github.com/S-A-RB05).


### Individual project - BingeBuster
The individual project is platform based on Netflix. Because I'm interested in services like Plex it would seem a good opportunity to learn more about it. Everything about this project can be found [here](https://github.com/Portfolio-Advanced-software/BingeBuster-WebUI).


### Start
<Explain your starting knowledge, experience, interests and what you would like to learn and achieve this semester>.



## Learning outcomes
Scale for every learning outcomes: undefined, orienting, beginning, proficient, advanced.

### Learning outcome 1 - Future-oriented Organization
You develop and deploy enterprise software, both individually and as a team, that fits the current question and needs of your stakeholders. Your final solution is designed with the possibility for future further development. 

#### Score

|---|---|---|---|
| 1.1 | Sprint 0 | Group project | Orienting |
| 1.2 | Sprint 1 | Individual project | Orienting |

#### Substantiation

1.1: Sprint 0
The first sprint I developed a feeling for what enterprise software means and started to translate it to user stories that keep certain enterprise topics into mind like speed and scalability to improve the customer's processes.

1.2: Sprint 1
I created simple non functional requirements that are linked to enterprise software and applicable to my individual project. [Non-functional requirements](https://github.com/Portfolio-Advanced-software/.github/blob/main/BingeBuster/Non-functional%20requirements%20BingeBuster.md)







### Learning Outcome 2 - Investigative Problem-Solving
You deliver professional products according to planning, which is the result of solving problems in a structured and methodical approach. You demonstrate a critical view towards your own and other people’s work.

#### Substantiation

1.1: Sprint 0
The first sprint I developed a feeling for what enterprise software means and started to translate it to user stories that keep certain enterprise topics into mind like speed and scalability to improve the customer's processes.

1.2: Sprint 1
I wrote a researchplan for my individual research that will help the group project ass well as my individual project. This plan can be found [here](https://github.com/Portfolio-Advanced-software/.github/blob/main/Research/Research%20plan%20micro%20service%20communication.md). Besides that I created user stories for my individual project they can be found [here](https://github.com/Portfolio-Advanced-software/.github/blob/main/BingeBuster/User%20stories%20BingeBuster.md).





### Learning Outcome 3 - Personal Leadership
You acquire skills required for your future career. You are aware of multiple career paths and can reflect which ones fit best, considering your (potential) skills and ambitions. You are aware of developments in software engineering and can signal trends. 

#### Score
| Id | Description | Type | Level |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1.1 | Sprint 1 | Individual project | Orienting |

#### Substantiation

1.1: Sprint 1
I'm already busy to prepare myself for a minor abroad so I'm busy with developing myself and my career. I will write more in [this document](https://github.com/Portfolio-Advanced-software/.github/blob/main/Personal%20development.md) to support this learning outcome.












### Learning Outcome 4 - Targeted Interaction
You use appropriate communication considering your role in a team, your audience and the medium to convey your message and results of your software development process.

#### Score
| Id | Description | Type | Level |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1.1 | Sprint 0 | Group project | Orienting |

#### Substantiation

1.1: Sprint 0
We had two great standups with our semester coach agreeing. We really started off great, because we immidiately created a jira board with user stories including story points that we figured out doing poker planning. We also created a group contract at the start to ensure everybody's availability and responsibility.









### Learning Outcome 5 - Scalable Architectures
Besides functionality, you develop the architecture of enterprise software based on quality attributes. You especially consider attributes most relevant to enterprise contexts with high volume data and events. You design your architecture with future adaptation in mind. Your development environment supports this by being able to independently deploy and monitor the running parts of your application. 

#### Score
| Id | Description | Type | Level |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1.1 | Sprint 0 | Group project | Orienting |
| 1.2 | Sprint 1 | Individual project | Orienting |

#### Substantiation

1.1: Sprint 0


1.2: Sprint 1
For my individual project I created a C1 & C2 model to base my project on. The architecture can be found [here](https://github.com/Portfolio-Advanced-software/.github/blob/main/BingeBuster/Architecture.md). Besides that I spent a lot of time figuring out how to create Dockerfiles and how to run MetaTrader inside a Docker container. I wrote a little tutorial about it that can be found [here](https://github.com/Portfolio-Advanced-software/.github/blob/main/Documentation/Creating%20docker%20container%20running%20MetaTrader%205.md). Finally I created a little POC to test communication between two GO servers using rabbitMQ that can be found [here](https://github.com/Portfolio-Advanced-software/GO-RabbitMQ-POC)






### Learning Outcome 6 - Development and Operations (DevOps)
You set up environments and tools which support your chosen software development process. You provide governance for all stakeholders’ goals. You aim for as much automation as possible, to enable short release times and high software quality.

### Learning Outcome 7 - Cloud Services
You can explain what a cloud platform provider is and can deploy (parts of) your application to a cloud platform. You integrate cloud services (for example: Serverless computing, cloud storage, container management) into your enterprise application, and can explain the added value of these cloud services for your application.

I did some research to find a cloud service for RabbitMQ for [my POC](https://github.com/Portfolio-Advanced-software/GO-RabbitMQ-POC). This would also come in handy for our group project because we can all use the same one and that'll make it easier for development and testing.

## Reflection
Reflect here on your (study) process per sprint.
Where are you getting stuck, what is going well, where do you need help. This is not about the content; you have described this in the learning outcomes. 

### Sprint 1
During sprint 1 I focussed to much on the group project and less on my individual project, that explains why certain things are still missing. Nevertheless did I do a great job in the group project and made a lot of progression and gathered knowledge.


## Conclusion
Here, at the end of the semester, you reflect on your process and end result. You can also refer back to the goals you set in the introduction, to see to what extent you were able to achieve them. 
Also mention what you are proud of, what you would like to do differently in the coming semesters and whether you have come to different insights about the field of study. Is there perhaps a particular subject you would like to explore further?
