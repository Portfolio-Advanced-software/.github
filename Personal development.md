# Personal development
This document will describe my intentions for my further development as a software engineer. As I am approaching the last year of my study I'm getting a clearer picture of what I want and don't want. 


## Minor
At the start of my study I never really thought of going abroad, instead for my minor I wanted to go in a completely different direction. For example social services or something around a medicine, because that draw my attention. During my study I started to realize what a unique and special opportunity it is to study abroad and decided that I want to do a minor abroad. After doing more research about this in semester 4 I decided that I wanted to broaden my software engineering skills and learn new topics. 

I'm convinced that studying abroad will bring me a lot of benefits, for starters I will be getting first hand experience on working with people from different countries, broadening my network and how different education systems are. It's a big step out of my comfort zone, but I think it is good and necessary to grow as a person and to stay active and keep a good view on life, which I think will make you better at your job (in the end). 

I started my journey with selecting schools in countries that I would like to visit and comparing them by courses and costs that come along while studying there. Some schools immidiately fell through, so i started comparing the schools environment (nature, school building, etc.). Most of the schools left over were in Scandinavian countries. Last February was the application deadlin so I made a final decision on my top 3 locations that I will briefly discuss here. 


### Humber College - Canada
I always wanted to travel to North America and stay there for a longer period of time. The duration of a semester is 5 months this seemed like a great chance to go there and combine it with studying. The campus of this school really draw my attention and they had great courses that I already saw my self doing. The reason I chose this school was because of the allround low costs, most of the schools in North America are pretty expensive and you don't get a scholarship. Beside the previous reasons you could also stay on campus which I would love to do. In short this school is the perfect match for me.

### NTNU - Norway
This school looked very unique and I love a cold climate, therefore I started looking into this school. They also had courses that I'm interested in but then with different topics. Additional I heard a lot of great things about the educational system in Scandinavian countries and it is a lot cheaper. Beside the school being a good fit, there's the opportunity to see the Northern Light which is high on my bucket list so this was a great factor in the consideration. I never visited Norway and am exciting to, so therefore it's my second choice.

### Halmstad University - Sweden
My third choice is a school that also had fun courses and a great school environment that seems very informal and a great space to learn. Its location has a lot of nature surrounding it which I really liked. While I love the country it's placed last, because I visited Sweden multiple times before. The place Halmstad looked like a fun place to be, where you could go to the city centre, but also go take a walk in the woods or on the beach.

### Nomination
I'm nominated for doing my minor at Halmstad University in Sweden. I already applied and selected my courses and am looking forward to hearing from them. After my application is accepted I will start applying for the Erasmus scholarship and taking care of the rest (housing, flight tickets, insurance, etc.)
