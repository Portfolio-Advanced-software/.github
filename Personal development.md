# Personal development
This document will describe my intentions for my further development as a software engineer. As I am approaching the last year of my study I'm getting a clearer picture of what I want and don't want. I want to go in the direction of a full-stack developer, but am certain that I don't want to be doing that for the bigger part of my life. This means I want to switch different job positions over time and don't stay to long in one place. I will be telling about me steps to finish my study and what I want my future to look like.


## Minor
At the start of my study I never really thought of going abroad, instead for my minor I wanted to go in a completely different direction. For example social services or something around a medicine, because that draw my attention. During my study I started to realize what a unique and special opportunity it is to study abroad and decided that I want to do a minor abroad. After doing more research about this in semester 4 I decided that I wanted to broaden my software engineering skills and learn new topics. 

I'm convinced that studying abroad will bring me a lot of benefits, for starters I will be getting first hand experience on working with people from different countries, broadening my network and how different education systems are. It's a big step out of my comfort zone, but I think it is good and necessary to grow as a person and to stay active and keep a good view on life, which I think will make you better at your job (in the end). 

I started my journey with selecting schools in countries that I would like to visit and comparing them by courses and costs that come along while studying there. Some schools immidiately fell through, so i started comparing the schools environment (nature, school building, etc.). Most of the schools left over were in Scandinavian countries. Last February was the application deadlin so I made a final decision on my top 3 locations that I will briefly discuss here. 


### Humber College - Canada
I always wanted to travel to North America and stay there for a longer period of time. The duration of a semester is 5 months this seemed like a great chance to go there and combine it with studying. The campus of this school really draw my attention and they had great courses that I already saw my self doing. The reason I chose this school was because of the allround low costs, most of the schools in North America are pretty expensive and you don't get a scholarship. Beside the previous reasons you could also stay on campus which I would love to do. In short this school is the perfect match for me.

### NTNU - Norway
This school looked very unique and I love a cold climate, therefore I started looking into this school. They also had courses that I'm interested in but then with different topics. Additional I heard a lot of great things about the educational system in Scandinavian countries and it is a lot cheaper. Beside the school being a good fit, there's the opportunity to see the Northern Light which is high on my bucket list so this was a great factor in the consideration. I never visited Norway and am exciting to, so therefore it's my second choice.

### Halmstad University - Sweden
My third choice is a school that also had fun courses and a great school environment that seems very informal and a great space to learn. Its location has a lot of nature surrounding it which I really liked. While I love the country it's placed last, because I visited Sweden multiple times before. The place Halmstad looked like a fun place to be, where you could go to the city centre, but also go take a walk in the woods or on the beach.

### Nomination
I'm nominated for doing my minor at Halmstad University in Sweden. I already applied and selected my courses and am looking forward to hearing from them. After my application is accepted I will start applying for the Erasmus scholarship and taking care of the rest (housing, flight tickets, insurance, etc.).


## Graduation
My first internship I did a business like project and while I liked doing it, it didn't involve a lot of software engineering. Therefore I want an internship where I can do things like full-stack web/app development. My preference would be at a company that is involved with an industry that I like, for example music, gaming or health care. I also prefer good connection between the company and me. I already started looking at internships on platforms like LinkedIn to be sure I have enough time at picking the best one for me. I also browse ASAM sometimes, I already found some assigments that I'm interested in. I still want to keep my options open and only approach a company that is really a fit. This will ofcourse change when I'm in the next semester. I will briefly discuss the assigments that I'm interested in.

### [Betawerk](https://asam.fhict.nl/student/Assignment/Details/d0db952b-1c59-4c8e-bcb7-9143a898faf5)
This company has an assigment on ASAM and it's in web development which I really like. The company has done work for companies in the health sector that also draws my attention. It also did work science related which also sounds cool to me. The company is based in Heerlen and that's a benefit because I don't have to travel that far, which is a plus if I have to go to the office five days in a week.

### [Handpicked agencies](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/search/?currentJobId=3562483520&distance=25.0&geoId=102890719&keywords=afstudeer%20ict&start=25)
I came across this assigment and because of the title "Full-stack developer" I became interested. Unfortunately it's a bit far away (Breda), but it's seems like a great place to work and develop your skills.

## Future path
After my study I'm not really sure what I want to do, I have narrowed it down to three choices: working, continue studying or doing volenteer work abroad. My plan is to decide at the time and maybe combine one or two with another. I will shortly explain my plan for the three topics and what I envision.

### Work
After my graduation internship it will depend if I liked the company and if they have job opportunities. Then I most likely would stick there and start working. I'm really looking forward to working in the sector that I've studied for for the last years. For now I don't want to start on my definite job, but I would like to get some job experience and become a better software developer. If I had to choose a job in the moment right now I would choose something around full stack developer. I browsed different vacancies and came across an interesting one:

#### [Software Developer voor Zorg-Lokaal](https://www.limburgvac.nl/vacatures/it-vacatures/automatisering/software-developer-zorg-lokaal-sittard-91174.html?utm_campaign=google_jobs_apply&utm_source=google_jobs_apply&utm_medium=organic)

### Study
I already looked at master studies in the field but there aren't that many so I will have to take a closer look what the study traject looks like and if I see myself doing it. I'm also interested in studying in a different field, but then not for a full-time study (4 years), so maybe I will do a short course or one next to my job. 

### Alternative
I also wanted to do some volunteer work at least once in my life and I came across this cool [website](https://www.volunteerworld.com/nl?tm=tt&ap=gads&aaid=adabsE5XzwUMV&gclid=Cj0KCQjwxYOiBhC9ARIsANiEIfb6yea0vKIWYfVjbrUS3ik35OSKP2v9YiuZeXWCvr3EqvILrSswh64aAkFpEALw_wcB) where you can search projects and sign up for them. The project duration varies a lot so I can pick one that has the perfect fit for me. I'm not sure when I want to do it, but I'm planning on doing it in the first 5 years after my study.
