# Non-functional requirements

NFR-01: A user is able to stream a movie without buffering or major quality/frame drops.
  - R-01: The internet speed of the user is at least 5Mbps.

NFR-02: For every user starting a stream there should automatically scale a new stream.
  - Q-01: The scaling should not prohibit the user to start a stream in less then a minute.

NFR-03: The user's connection to the stream is encrypted so the user's current watch behaviour is not exposed.
