# Which technique is the most optimal way of communicating between micro services?
To answer this question I'm going to divide it into sub questions and answer them first and it will result in answering the main question.





## Which techniques/protocols for micro service communication are available?


### Literature study 
To come up with as many valid protocols, techniques, etc. I consulted the internet and did a community search. I made a list with techniques, patterns, ways and protocols.
