# Research plan micro service communication

## Problem/opportunity
This semester it is required for micro services to be able to communicate with each other. Because I have little knowledge about this topic, but it is largely used in software development it seems like a great and wise opportunity to research this topic.

## Research questions
### Which technique is the most optimal way of communicating between micro services?
•	Which techniques/protocols for micro service communication are available? </br>
•	What are the (dis)advantages of synchronous or asynchronous communication? </br>
•	What is the role of message brokers? </br>
•	What is the role of API gateways in micro service communication? </br>
•	How does service discovery work to ensure communication between unknown micro services? </br>
•	What is the impact of containerization on micro service communication? </br>
•	How does the choice of communication protocol impact the performance and scalability of microservices? </br>
•	How can micro service communication be secured to prevent unauthorized access? </br>
•	What are the best practices for testing and monitoring microservice communication to ensure reliability and performance?



## Plan
| <b> Research phase </b>	| <b> Methods </b> |
| ----------------------- | ---------------- |
| Gather information </br> The goal of this phase will be to gather knowledge about the topic. This means exploring what different techniques and protocols are out there and how to implement them. Each individual technique should be invested more deeply to already get a feeling how it should work. | Literature study </br> Community research </br> Best good and bad practices |
| Apply information </br> The goal of this phase is to put the knowledge to use by prototyping different basic setups of communication between two micro services. | Prototyping | 
| Testing </br> The goal of this phase is to test the prototype on different criteria, most definitely this will be speed and security. | Security tests </br> Non-functional tests </br> Benchmark tests |
| Validating </br> The goal of the last phase is to gather all of the results and compare them with each other. To come to a conclusion the different options will be checked on multiple criteria to come to the most optimal solution. | Multi-criteria decision making |
